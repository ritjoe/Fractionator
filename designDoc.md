# Fractionator

**Team** : Jacob Westerback, Brian Sandon, Megan Smith

[Source Code](https://github.com/Fractionators/sugarizer)

### Short Description
Fractionator will be a game for fourth graders focusing on the topic of Number and Operations — Fractions: Teaching the extended understanding of fraction equivalence and ordering. Students will be asked to place visualizations of fractions in the correct order.

## Goals
* Moveable Fraction “Cards”
	* Fraction Number Cards
	* Pie Chart Cards
	* Combo mode
* Difficulty Settings
	* Changes the amount of cards generated
* Replay Button
* Attractive visual design
* Follow good code practices
* Presentation
	* Make your slides web-accessible
	* Speak for a roughly equal amount of the presentation.
	* Demonstrate
	* Questions
		* What are some of the best pieces of software you wrote? Why?
		* What are some of the worst pieces? Why?
		* What stumbling blocks were there? What successes?
		* What would you have done differently?
		* What would you have worked on if you'd had more time?

### Stretch Goals
* Multiple Mode
	* Matching Pie Visualization to Numeric Visualization to Decimal Visualization
* Timed Mode
	* Function Similar as a test

## Specs
* Build and Run for [XO](http://laptop.org/en/laptop/index.shtml)
* Post on [wiki](http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Math4Team/RIT/Projects)
* licensed under an OSI-compatible license
* ensure source repository contain clear written instructions for future developers
* Post Mortem
	* What TODO items are left to do? 
	* Does it work on python on a normal machine? 
	* Does it work on the OLPC? Code quality and git commit history. 
	* Quality of the wiki entry at sugarlabs.org
